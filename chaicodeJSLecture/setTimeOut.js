/*
js engine ->>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>.

js engine is single threaded and synchronous but
 it has some async behaviour because of web api and callback queue and event loop and task queue and micro task queue 
and promise and async await and setTimeOut and setInterval and setImmediate 
and process.nextTick and requestAnimationFrame and mutation observer and intersection 
observer and resize observer and performance observer and idle callback and service worker and web worker and
 web socket and web rtc and web assembly and webgl and webvr and webxr and webgpu

------------------------------js engline has callstack , which execture the js code in synchronous way
but  setTimeOut() function is part of browser ,  its not part of JS engine , its part of web api
so when we call setTimeOut() function, it will be executed by web api(Browser) and not by js engine
setTimeOut is browser feature,
*/


/*
js engine has call stack which will execture these in such sequence->
1 console.log("hellow from js");
2 setTimeout(obj.greet,2*1000); 
3. console.log("by by");

-> seqence of exection : 1->3->2 


->> broweser directly doesnt push anything in callstack, browser put code in callback queue. 
now from callback queue , event loop will push the code in callstack
 event loop will check if callstack is empty or not, if empty then it will push the code from callback queue to callstack
    and then it will execute the code in callstack
*/

/*
ðŸ”¹ How setTimeout Works with the Event Loop
JavaScript engine sees setTimeout() and sends it to the Web API.
Web API starts the timer (e.g., 2 seconds countdown).
Meanwhile, JavaScript continues executing other synchronous code.
After 2 seconds, the callback is placed in the Task Queue.
The Event Loop checks if the Call Stack is empty and then executes the callback.
